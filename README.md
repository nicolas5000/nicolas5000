## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some informations about me:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning domotics:
  - Home Assistant
  - Zigbee / Zigbee2MQTT
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 2 projects:
  - Using ESP32-C6 Zigbee module connected to Diagral IAS (Intruder Alarm System) to manage from and get information to Home Assistant through Z2M
  - Using ESP32-C6 Zigbee module connected to Daikin indoors unit to manage it using Home Assistant through Z2M (kind of Faikin but using Zigbee instead of WiFi)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help to speed up development on these 2 subjects, from people knowing ESP32-IDF / Zigbee / C programming. I already have most of the serial protocol to communicate with Daikin, thanks to Faikin, and Diagral serial link on GSM module interface that I reversed.
